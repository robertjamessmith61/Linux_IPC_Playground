# Linked List

This is a very basic Linked List library. It should be modified to suit your needs.

## Description

There are better implimentations of a Linked List out there, but this is a simple one I have made for my own purposes.
Simply add the .c and .h files to another project and modify them as needed. I have not bothered building this as a dll
library or anything like that.

Technically this might almost count as a Dictionary because I have included a key in the Node struct.
