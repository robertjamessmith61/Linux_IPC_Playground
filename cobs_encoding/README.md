# COBS Encoding
This is a simple project which defines two functions for encoding and decoding char arrays with the Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing (COBS) framing.

Simply copy both the source (cobs_encoding.c) and header (cobs_encoding.h) files into your own project to make use of the functions.
